# Towards Artificially Intelligent Nursing Homes: A Scoping Review of Palliative Interventions

This repository houses all code for the paper, 'Towards Artificially Intelligent Nursing Homes: A Scoping Review of Palliative Interventions.' The most recent version of the paper can be found in this repository under the 'article' folder. 


## A Couple of Key Points
- Python version 3.12.3 was used.
- Pip version 24.0 was used.
- All necessary packages are included in requirements.txt


## Preliminary Findings
- There are many European studies, all characterised by their small datasets.
- US, Australian, and Asian studies also feature, with many of these papers featuring much more robust and standardised datasets.
- There is a lack of open-source data available.
- There seems to be conventional use of simplistic machine learning algorithms in clinical data-based studies. 
- Unsupervised machine learning methods are barely used. 
- There is a clear divide in the literature between Intelligent Physical Systems (IPS) and Decision-Support Systems (DSS)
- End-User involvement is needed in system development and evaluation processes.
- There is no standard definition of palliative care.


## Potential Moves Forward 
- Synthetic data generation to combat issues surrounding data availability issues. 
- A move towards palliative tools as opposed to emotional aids (ACP Family Meeting Smart Glasses Transcriber). 
- Using nurse notes and free-text data in decision support systems as an internationally-applicable form of data. 
- Palliative care definitions should be included in future work.
