To combat loneliness and social isolation in nursing homes, this trial presents a study during which social networks of nursing home residents and elderly hospital patients were maintained through virtual encounters and robots, respectively. The observational trial included volunteers who were either residents of nursing homes or patients in a geriatric hospital. Each volunteer was asked to fill in a questionnaire containing three questions to measure loneliness. The questionnaire also documented whether video telephony via the robot, an alternative contact option (for example, a phone call), or no contact with relatives had taken place. The aim was to work out the general acceptance and the benefits of virtual encounters using robots for different roles (users, relatives, nursing staff, facilities). Seventy volunteers with three possible interventions (non-contact, virtual encounters by means of a robot, and any other contact) took part in this trial. The frequency of use of the robot increased steadily over the course of the study, and it was regularly used in all facilities during the weeks of visitor bans (n = 134 times). In the hospital, loneliness decreased significantly among patients for whom the robot was used to provide contact (F(1,25) = 7.783, p = 0.01). In the nursing homes, no demonstrable effect could be achieved in this way, although the subject feedback from the users was consistently positive. © 2021 by the authors.

We collected the experiences of 10 people aged 80-92 who used a pre-market social robot, GenieConnect, for between 2 to 35 days during the COVID19 pandemic restrictions. GenieConnect is a table-top robot with a large face and animated eyes, designed for support and companionship. The robot asked 'how are you feeling, Name' each day and delivered lifestyle prompts such as medication reminders. We observed conflicting responses from participants - five expressed positive responses, three negative (two of these withdrew) and two neutral. Positive comments included 'feeling not alone'; 'having someone to talk to'; and enjoying being asked 'how are you feeling'. Negative comments were mainly related to not liking the eyes. Design adaptations were made to increase acceptance. We conclude that robots like GenieConnect could reduce loneliness when a user-centred design approach is taken. © 2022 IEEE.","2022","2024-04-17 08:58:57","2024-05-03 14:36:49","","1095-1099","","","2022-March","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","ISSN: 2167-2148","","/Users/isabel/Zotero/storage/LKN8RH75/Wilson et al. - 2022 - Affective Responses of Older Adults to the Anthrop.pdf","","read; included","Human robot interaction; companion robot; loneliness; robot acceptance; senior adults","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The analysis on the temporal and spatial distribution of human resources and non-human resources in LTCFs, could provide a basis to optimize resource allocation and efficient use of limited resources. Methods: This study used data envelopment analysis to comprehensively evaluate the efficiency of human and non-human resources in different time spans and regions. The spatial Markov chain and spatial correlation were also applied to explore the heterogeneity of and correlation between the service efficiency of LTCFs in different regions and then analyzes the influencing factors of efficiency using Tobit regression model. Results: The quantitative changes in the service efficiency of LTCFs in various provinces showed a “W” shape in two periods, ranging from 0.8 to 1.6. The overall efficiency of LTCFs in different regions had a lower probability to achieve short-term cross-stage development. Non-human resource efficiency presented a “cluster” distribution mode, demonstrating a great probability to achieve cross-stage development, which might be due to the regional disparities of economic development and land resource. Tobit regression analysis results also showed that the comprehensive efficiency of LTCFs decreases by 0.210 for every square increase in construction space variation. However, human resource efficiency had a significant spatial polarization, making it difficult to develop area linkages. The reason for this might be the nursing staff have relatively stable regional characteristics, weakening the inter-provincial spatial connection. We also found that female workers, aged between 35 and 45 can positively affect the efficiency of LTCFs. Those staff stay focused and improve their skills, which might improve the efficiency of LTCFs. So improving technology and service quality changes by increasing female workers, aged between 35 and 45, and avoiding excessive construction space changes can enhance the growth of service quality and personnel stability of LTCFs. Conclusion: There is an urgent trade-off among staff quality improvement, resource reduction, construction excessive and substantial regional variation in efficiency. Therefore, strengthening policy support to encourage inter-regional initiatives, particularly highlighting the development of human resources interaction and common development is urgent.

A thorough study based on computer vision methods","Visual Computer","","0178-2789","10.1007/s00371-021-02242-y","","Social Assistive Robotics is increasingly being used in care settings to provide psychosocial support and interventions for the elderly with cognitive impairments. Most of these social robots have provided timely stimuli to the elderly at home and in care centres, including keeping them active and boosting their mood. However, previous investigations have registered shortcomings in these robots, particularly in their ability to satisfy an essential human need: the need for companionship. Reports show that the elderly tend to lose interests in these social robots after the initial excitement as the novelty wears out and the monotonous familiarity becomes all too familiar. This paper presents our research facilitating conversations between a social humanoid robot, Nadine, and cognitively impaired elderly at a nursing home. We analysed the effectiveness of human–humanoid interactions between our robot and 14 elderly over 29 sessions. We used both objective tools (based on computer vision methods) and subjective tools (based on observational scales) to evaluate the recorded videos. Our findings showed that our subjects engaged positively with Nadine, suggesting that their interaction with the robot could improve their well-being by compensating for some of their emotional, cognitive, and psychosocial deficiencies. We detected emotions associated with cognitively impaired elderly during these interactions. This study could help understand the expectations of the elderly and the current limitations of Social Assistive Robots.

One strategy to address this growing gap in many regions is the use of care robots. Although there have been numerous ethical debates about the use of robots in nursing and elderly care, an important question remains unexamined: how do the potential recipients of such care perceive situations with care robots compared to situations with human caregivers? Using a large-scale experimental vignette study, we investigated people’s affective attitudes toward care robots. Specifically, we studied the influence of the caregiver’s nature on participants’ perceived comfort levels when confronted with different care scenarios in nursing homes. Our results show that the care-robot-related views of actual care recipients (i.e., people who are already affected by care dependency) differ substantially from the views of people who are not affected by care dependency. Those who do not (yet) rely on care placed care robots’ value far below that of human caregivers, especially in a service-oriented care scenario. This devaluation was not found among care recipients, whose perceived level of comfort was not influenced by the caregiver’s nature. These findings also proved robust when controlled for people’s gender, age, and general attitudes toward robots.","2023-06-01","2024-04-17 09:02:19","2024-05-04 16:39:11","2024-04-17 09:02:19","1007-1024","","6","15","","Int J of Soc Robotics","The Care-Dependent are Less Averse to Care Robots","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/isabel/Zotero/storage/332P9ZM3/Schönmann et al. - 2023 - The Care-Dependent are Less Averse to Care Robots.pdf","","read; included","Nursing care; Affective attitudes; Care robots; Robot aversion; Vignette experiment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Maryland Department of Human Services distributed Amazon Echoshow 8 voice and touchscreen controlled smart speakers (VTCSS) to a sample of their institutionalized guardianship clients to enhance caseworker access during the pandemic. Research Design and Methods: This pilot study focused on understanding VTCSS use challenges and the effects on clients' safety and well-being. Two focus groups were conducted with caseworkers (N = 16) who piloted the devices. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using open and axial coding. Results: Four themes were identified, including challenges to providing casework during the pandemic (e.g., facility technology gaps), challenges to device installation and use (e.g., privacy concerns), strategies for overcoming challenges (e.g., alert features), and benefits (e.g., stimulation, care monitoring) and uses (e.g., enhanced access, entertainment). Discussion and Implications: VTCSS show great promise to engage the client, maintain visual access, and monitor quality of care.

Quantitative outcomes of interest reported in the current paper were health-related quality of life (SF-36), loneliness (ULS-8), and perceptions of robotic cultural competence (CCATool-Robotics). Thirty-three residents completed all procedures. The difference in SF-36 Emotional Wellbeing scores between Experimental Group and Care As Usual participants over time was significant (F[1] = 6.614, sig = .019, ηp2 = .258), as was the comparison between Any Robot used and Care As Usual (F[1] = 5.128, sig = .031, ηp2 = .146). There were no significant changes in SF-36 physical health subscales.

This process leads to a significantly greater number of care workers that will be needed in the future. Concurrently, the demands on caregivers concerning the amount of care and quality of care are increasing. Socially-assistive robots (SARs) are a promising resource in this regard. At the same time, research that directly addresses the target group of elderly persons with cognitive impairments is underrepresented. This study reports observations regarding the interaction between a SAR and elderly people with cognitive impairments. Seven observational and behavioural measures were conducted during the interaction between residents of a nursing home and the SAR named “James”. Twelve participants from two residential homes took part in the study. Data were analysed by using content analysis and interpreted along a technology acceptance model. Verbal comments and observable emotions of the SAR were predominantly positive, only a few participants reacted negatively to the SAR “James”. There was also hardly any shyness to touch the robot. The participants made eye contact and responded adequately to the robot’s requests. Tasks which were set by the SAR in group settings led to a higher communication between the participants than tasks in single-user settings. The mainly upbeat emotions and interaction with the SAR indicates a positive attitude towards the system. Long-term studies are needed to investigate the sustainability of robot acceptance. © The Author(s) 2023.","2024","2024-04-17 09:08:31","2024-05-01 13:23:27","","403-413","","2","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p>imbalanced data (10 women 2 men)</p> <p>nursing staff approached residents specifically</p> <p></p> </div>","/Users/isabel/Zotero/storage/ZYVYDMH2/Rettinger et al. - 2024 - Observing the Interaction between a Socially-Assis.pdf; /Users/isabel/Zotero/storage/RS8MX6XT/display.html","","read; included","Dementia; Technology acceptance; Elderly with mild cognitive impairments; Human–robot-interaction; Socially-assistive robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, the situation of elderly citizens requires real-time attention, especially when dangerous situations such as falls occur. If staff cannot find and deal with them promptly, it might become a serious problem. For such a situation, many kinds of human motion detection systems have been in development, many of which are based on portable devices attached to a user’s body or external sensing devices such as cameras. However, portable devices can be inconvenient for users, while optical cameras are affected by lighting conditions and face privacy issues. In this study, a human motion detection system using a low-resolution infrared array sensor was developed to protect the safety and privacy of people who need to be cared for in hospitals and nursing homes. The proposed system can overcome the above limitations and have a wide range of application. The system can detect eight kinds of motions, of which falling is the most dangerous, by using a three-dimensional convolutional neural network. As a result of experiments of 16 participants and cross-validations of fall detection, the proposed method could achieve 98.8% and 94.9% of accuracy and F1-measure, respectively. They were 1% and 3.6% higher than those of a long short-term memory network, and show feasibility of real-time practical application. © 2020 by the authors.

Currently, the best identification approach is through time-consuming regular geriatric assessments. This study aimed to develop and validate a retrospective electronic frailty index (reFI) to track the health status of people staying at RACs using the daily routine operational data records. Methods: We have access to patient records from the Royal Freemasons Benevolent Institution RACs (Australia) over the age of 65, spanning 2010 to 2021. The reFI was developed using the cumulative deficit frailty model whose value was calculated as the ratio of number of present frailty deficits to the total possible frailty indicators (32). Frailty categories were defined using population quartiles. 1, 3 and 5-year mortality were used for validation. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier estimate. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using Cox regression analyses and the association was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: Two thousand five hundred eighty-eight residents were assessed, with an average length of stay of 1.2 ± 2.2 years. The RAC cohort was generally frail with an average reFI of 0.21 ± 0.11. According to the Kaplan-Meier estimate, survival varied significantly across different frailty categories (p < 0.01). The estimated hazard ratios (HRs) were 1.12 (95% CI 1.09–1.15), 1.11 (95% CI 1.07–1.14), and 1.1 (95% CI 1.04–1.17) at 1, 3 and 5 years. The ROC analysis of the reFI for mortality outcome showed an area under the curve (AUC) of ≥0.60 for 1, 3 and 5-year mortality. Conclusion: A novel reFI was developed using the routine data recorded at RACs. reFI can identify changes in the frailty index over time for elderly people, that could potentially help in creating personalised care plans for addressing their health deterioration. © 2022, The Author(s).","2022","2024-04-17 09:13:25","2024-05-03 10:07:40","","","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p>existing work has used a combination of progress notes, observation charts and assessment forms</p> </div>","/Users/isabel/Zotero/storage/K9UIHHGW/Sarwar et al. - 2022 - Development and validation of retrospective electr.pdf; /Users/isabel/Zotero/storage/D68X7M5J/display.html","","read; included","Electronic health records; Mortality; Frail elderly; Frailty index; Aged care homes; Health deterioration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The system consists of an array of Wii Balance Boards (WBB) and an exergame that estimates whether the player can maintain physical independence, comparing the results with the 30 s Chair-Stand Test (30CST). Methods: Sixteen participants recruited at a nursing home performed the 30CST and then played the exergame described here as often as desired during a period of 2 weeks. For each session, features related to walking and standing on the WBBs while playing the exergame were collected. Different classifier algorithms were used to predict the result of the 30CST on a binary basis as able or unable to maintain physical independence. Results: By using a Logistic Model Tree, we achieved a maximum accuracy of 91% when estimating whether player’s 30CST scores were over or under a threshold of 12 points, our findings suggest that predicting age- and sex-adjusted cutoff scores is feasible. Conclusion: An array of WBBs seems to be a viable solution to estimate lower extremity strength and thereby functional performance in a non-invasive and continuous manner.

Results: A total of 31 older adults were included in the study, with a mean age of 84 ± 8.71 years old. The main findings obtained were that a greater number of steps and distance could be related to a lower probability of falling, of dependency in basic activities of daily living, or of mobility problems.

Detecting the deterioration of patients could provide an early warning to their families in instances of homecare, to clinicians treating hospitalized patients and to nurses by clients of retirement homes. Traditional supervised machine learning is not helpful for this purpose because the deterioration has individual differences for each patient, and the model cannot access the information about deterioration from healthy patients. This paper applies one-class classification (OCC) to detect deterioration changes. OCC can provide an early warning because the model can learn from only normal conditions. In particular, a one-class time-series classification (OCTSC) algorithm has been developed by combining K-means clustering with sliding windows and a linear regression subtask. The core idea is to detect the change in the signal period related to heart/breathing rate. For this purpose, clustering is applied to sliding windows, and the period is estimated using linear regression for the time index of arbitrary cluster. The deterioration change is detected by unseen scores computed as the error of linear regression subtask for cluster index. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","2024","2024-04-17 09:16:54","2024-05-01 14:36:54","","","","","657","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","/Users/isabel/Zotero/storage/5C8PWC75/Hayashi et al. - 2024 - Patient deterioration detection using one-class cl.pdf; /Users/isabel/Zotero/storage/SD9ABVVX/display.html","","read; included","Linear regression; Ballistocardiogram; Clustering; Deterioration; One-class classification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This concept paper presents a smart textile prototype to both entertain and monitor/assess the behavior of the relevant clients. The prototype includes physical computing components for music playing and simple interaction, but additionally games and data logging systems, to determine baselines of activity and interaction. Using microelectronics, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and capacitive touch sensors woven into a fabric, the study demonstrates the kinds of augmentations possible over the normal manipulation of the traditional non-smart activity apron by incorporating light and sound effects as feedback when patients interact with different regions of the textile. A data logging system will record the patient’s behavioral patterns. This would include the location, frequency, and time of the patient’s activities within the different textile areas. The textile will be placed across the laps of the resident, which they then play with, permitting the development of a behavioral profile through the gamification of cognitive tests. This concept paper outlines the development of a prototype sensor system and highlights the challenges related to its use in a care home setting. The research implements a wide range of functionality through a novel architecture involving loosely coupling and concentrating artifacts on the top layer and technology on the bottom layer. Components in a loosely coupled system can be replaced with alternative implementations that provide the same services, and so this gives the solution the best flexibility. The literature shows that existing architectures that are strongly coupled result in difficulties modeling different individuals without incurring significant costs. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the training activity can increase the stress level, especially in persons affected by a chronic stress condition. Wearable technologies and m-health solutions can support the person, the medical specialist, and long-term care facilities to efficiently implement personalised therapy solutions by monitoring the stress level of each subject during the motor and cognitive training. In this paper we present a comprehensive work on this topic, starting from a pilot study involving a group of frail older adults suffering from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) who actively participated in cognitive and motor rehabilitation sessions equipped with wearable physiological sensors and a mobile application for physiological monitoring. We analyse the collected data to investigate the stress response of frail older subjects during the therapy, and how the cognitive training is positively affected by physical exercise. Then, we evaluated a stress detection system based on several machine learning algorithms in order to highlight their performances on the real dataset we collected. However, stress detection algorithms generally provide only the identification of a stressful/non stressful event, which is not sufficient to personalise the therapy. Therefore, we propose a mobile system architecture for online stress monitoring able to infer the stress level during a session. The obtained result is then used as input for a Decision Support System (DSS) in order to support the medical user in the definition of a personalised therapy for frail older adults.","2020","2024-04-17 09:19:34","2024-05-01 13:22:44","2024-04-17 09:19:34","65573-65590","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","/Users/isabel/Zotero/storage/UQ3CW487/9055213.html; /Users/isabel/Zotero/storage/JAAVXS72/Delmastro et al. - 2020 - Cognitive Training and Stress Detection in MCI Fra.pdf","","read; included","machine learning; Biomedical monitoring; Monitoring; Wearable sensors; Training; Medical treatment; wearable sensors; Decision support systems; Stress; m-health; Cognitive training; decision support system; physiological data analysis; stress detection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Background There is a lack of knowledge about implementing technologies in NHs and the ethical challenges that might arise. In past studies, nursing care teams expressed the need for technologies offering clinical support. Technologies like an IVS and an app could prove useful in NHs to prevent and manage falls and responsive behaviours. Design An exploratory qualitative study was conducted with care managers, family caregivers and formal caregivers in five NHs. Methods Each participant was shown a presentation of a potential app and a short video on an IVS. It was followed by an individual semi-structured interview. A conventional content analysis was performed. Findings Potential users found it would be possible to implement these technologies in NHs even if resistance could be expected. To facilitate adoption and achieve clinical benefits, the implementation of technologies should be pilot-tested, and coaching activities should be planned. Ethical risks were considered already present in NHs even without technologies, for example, risks to privacy. Strategies were proposed, for instance, to adapt the code of ethics and procedures. Some potential prejudices about the interest and abilities of older staff, nurses' aides, and family caregivers to use technology were identified. Conclusions Through rigorous and ethical implementation, technologies supporting clinical care processes could benefit older people living in NHs, as well as their relatives and the staff. Implications for practice Various strategies are proposed to successfully implement technologies. Effort should be made to avoid prejudices during implementation, and procedures should be adapted to mitigate possible ethical challenges.","2019","2024-04-18 16:18:18","2024-05-05 09:57:59","2024-04-18 16:18:18","e12266","","4","14","","","Conditions and ethical challenges that could influence the implementation of technologies in nursing homes","","","","","","","en","© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/opn.12266","","/Users/isabel/Zotero/storage/IB5AAJZZ/Bourbonnais et al. - 2019 - Conditions and ethical challenges that could influ.pdf; /Users/isabel/Zotero/storage/NALLTM9W/opn.html","","read; manual; included","nursing homes; implementation; mobile applications; technologies; qualitative research; accidental falls; behavioural symptoms; videomonitoring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For the widespread adoption of new technology, it must be locally demonstrable and become normalized. Objective The aim of this study was to install smart speakers in care homes in a rural and coastal region and to explore if and how the devices were being used, the barriers to their implementation, and their potential benefits. Methods Email, workshops, drop-in sessions, phone, and cold calling was used to contact all 230 care homes, offering a free smart speaker and some advisory support. Care homes accepting the devices were asked to complete a feedback diary. Nonresponse rate for diary completion was high and was thus supplemented with a telephone survey. Results Over the course of 7 months, we installed 156 devices in 92 care homes for older people, 50 devices for people with physical or mental health needs, and 8 for others. The devices were used mainly for music but also for poetry, recipes, light controls, jokes, and video calls. Care home managers reported the benefits for the residents, including enhanced engagement with home activities, enjoyment, calming effects, and the acquisition of new skills. Implementation problems included internet connectivity, staff capacity, and skills. Conclusions Affordable consumer devices such as smart speakers should be installed in all care homes to benefit residents. Voice-activated technologies are easy to use and promote interaction. This study indicates that implementation in care homes was possible and that smart speakers had multifaceted benefits for residents and staff. Most care homes in this region now use smart speakers for their residents, thereby normalizing this practice.","2021-12-20","2024-04-30 10:57:12","2024-05-03 16:02:14","2024-04-30 10:57:12","e26767","","12","23","","J Med Internet Res","The Use of Smart Speakers in Care Home Residents","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 34932010 PMCID: PMC8726051","","/Users/isabel/Zotero/storage/Y53C8BET/Edwards et al. - 2021 - The Use of Smart Speakers in Care Home Residents .pdf; /Users/isabel/Zotero/storage/EJ33PV8S/PDF.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8726051/","read; included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
